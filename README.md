# PasswordManager
Simple password manager that stores information in plaintext

Password manager holds a text file containing the usernames/passwords of the people who've used it. 

Login with your username/password and the manager will open or create the password textfile corresponding to your account. 

The password text file contains the application, username, and password of whatever you add using the Add password button.



After including your credentials, you can use the copy button to copy the password to your clipboard or reveal the password in the table to type manually.



I wouldn't recommend actually using this for storing your passwords since it doesn't encrypt any of the files.  (Soonâ„¢?)
